        You must visit the bank in person to open an account. The requirements may differ by bank; therefore, it is advisable <br>
        to consult or visit the bank's website beforehand. However, most banks require the following:<br><br>
        
        <ul>
        <li>A valid ID with your photo and clearly displayed information. The identification document could be a passport, <br>
        driver's license, major credit card, or any other legally issued ID. Despite the fact that the central bank has decreased <br>
        the number of required IDs from two to one, many banks continue to request two forms of identification.</li>
        <li>Two identification photos (often 1x1 or passport size).</li>
        <li>Proof of address</li>
        <li>A bank-specific minimum starting deposit </li>
        </ul>
